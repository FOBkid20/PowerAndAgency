# Power And Agency Connotation Frames in Film Scripts and Film Reviews

This repository contains the notebooks I used to replicate the paper [Connotation Frames of Power and Agency in Modern Films](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~msap/pdfs/sap2017connotation.pdf), extend it to film reviews, improve upon some of its techniques, and analyze the results. The datasets used in this code are not added to this repo due to size, so this code cannot be run as-is.
