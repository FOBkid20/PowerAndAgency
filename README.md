# Power And Agency Connotation Frames in Film Scripts and Film Reviews

This repository contains the notebooks I used to replicate the paper [Connotation Frames of Power and Agency in Modern Films](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~msap/pdfs/sap2017connotation.pdf), extend it to film reviews, improve upon some of its techniques, and analyze the results. The datasets used in this code are not added to this repo due to size, so this code cannot be run as-is. 

There are three jupyter notebooks: Connotation Frames of Power and Agency in Film Reviews-Replicating Original.ipynb, Connotation Frames of Power and Agency in Film Reviews.ipynb, and Comparing Scripts and Reviews.ipynb. The first contains the code to replicate the original paper, and uses scripts from the [ScriptBase Corpus](https://github.com/EdinburghNLP/scriptbase). The second contains the code used to apply the technique to movie reviews, and uses reviews from IMDb's [Large Movie Review Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) as well as IMDb's principals [dataset](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/). In order to run these notebooks, one would need to download the appropriate data from those sources. The third Jupyter notebook contains code used to analyze the outputs of the first two notebooks, and can be run as-is using the csvs provided (scripts_power_and_agency.csv and reviews_power_and_agency.csv).
